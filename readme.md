My name is Will Earp, alias Hexydec, I am a full stack developer based in the UK. I have always had a passion for technology, and was lucky to be in my mid-teens when the Internet started to become a thing.

## About Me

After developing a personal website using Microsoft Frontpage (before promptly binning it to edit the raw HTML), I landed job as a web designer in 1998, and haven't stopped developing since.

I love to craft bespoke solutions, that have been implemented from the ground up to produce robust, maintainable and efficient solutions. I have a passion for website performance and databases.

I now use my skills to [help make the internet a safer place as Digital Experience Manager at SWGfL](https://swgfl.org.uk), and to develop free software.
